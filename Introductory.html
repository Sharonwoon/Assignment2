            Our objective in this Assignment is to dive deeper into the nature of influenza by analyzing
            and presenting key datasets gathered through extensive research. These datasets will provide
            an guide for us to work into various aspects of each category, like how fast rates are, vaccination rates are be given out, 
            and the impact on different demographic groups of ages. <br><br>

                </p>

            To make readability more acessible to every audience as to what data visualization is all about we will improve the quality of the chart, bar 
            and dataset in order to fully utlize and enchance the reading ability. We will use every concepts are is learnt throughout the Course to offer a real-time 
            understanding of the pattern in each dataset represented
