            Influenza has proven to be a very dangerous disease that can be transmitted to almost anyone. Therefore Our goal for this 
            is to talk about and display each dataset we have collected from very much intensive researches. <br><br>

            Our objective in this Assignment is to dive deeper into the nature of influenza by analyzing
            and presenting key datasets gathered through extensive research. These datasets will provide
            an guide for us to work into various aspects of each category, like how fast rates are, vaccination rates are be given out, 
            and the impact on different demographic groups of ages. <br><br>

                
                <p class="Datasets">
                •Influenza Rate Bar Graph <br><br>
                •Influenza Rate World Map <br><br>
                •Influenza vaccination Rate <br><br>
                •Influenza Mortality Rate between Kids below age 12 and Adults above Age 65 <br><br>
                •xxxxxxxxxx<br><br>
                </p>

            To make readability more acessible to every audience as to what data visualization is all about we will improve the quality of the chart, bar 
            and dataset in order to fully utlize and enchance the reading ability. We will use every concepts are is learnt throughout the Course to offer a real-time 
            understanding of the pattern in each dataset represented

            The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

            Ooh, black and yellow!
            Let's shake it up a little.
            Barry! Breakfast is ready!
            Coming!
            Hang on a second.
            Hello?
            Barry?
            Adam?
            Can you believe this is happening?
            I can't.
            I'll pick you up.
            Looking sharp.
            Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
            Sorry. I'm excited.
            Here's the graduate.
            We're very proud of you, son.
            A perfect report card, all B's.
            Very proud.
            Ma! I got a thing going here.
            You got lint on your fuzz.
            Ow! That's me!
            Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
            Bye!
            Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
            Hey, Adam.
            Hey, Barry.
            Is that fuzz gel?
            A little. Special day, graduation.
            Never thought I'd make it.
            Three days grade school, three days high school.
            Those were awkward.
            Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
            You did come back different.
            Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
            Hear about Frankie?
            Yeah.
            You going to the funeral?
            No, I'm not going.
            Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
            Don't waste it on a squirrel.
            Such a hothead.
            I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
            I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
            That's why we don't need vacations.
            Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
            Well, Adam, today we are men.
            We are!
            Bee-men.
            Amen!
            Hallelujah!

            Heads up! Here we go.
            Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
            Wonder what it'll be like?
